This is the first release of a set of programs
for control of midi instruments on mac os-x

midi_driver    - is a native midi driver using CoreMidi
coca_interface - is a native interface to cocoa
playsoftmidi   - is programs that sends midi events to the builtin mac
	         synt module

This code is not of production quality - and only has sparse
documentation.

All comments and corrects are welcome
