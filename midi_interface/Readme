This is a first attempt at a midi driver

It works most of the time but sometimes it crashes on startup
I have no idea why

The program is hard wired to receive midi events from VPMK

VPMK is a virtual keyboard and can be downloaded from
vmpk.sourceforge.net

Instructions:

  start VPMK
  type Make

Note this driver just detect midi event mo sounds are played
